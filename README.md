nAssembler
==========

Assembler for TI Nspire ARM, running on-calc or on computer
Written in python. You need micropython on your calc to use it.

Launch using micropython. Specify input and output file paths on the prompt.
(e.g. /documents/clrscr.asm.tns)


Assembly language
-----------------
(Also look at the examples)
Instruction names must have preceding whitespace
Labels must not have any preceding whitespace
The instruction names and syntax are like in standard ARM assembly
All usual instructions are supported
The DCD, DCB and ALIGN directives are supported

Pseudo instruction (like PUSH, ADR etc) are not implemented at the moment.
Other instructions may be missing (report if you need one).
